    "## Aim: \n",
    "To predict which farmers will turn training into action\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Statement:\n",
    "Access to high-quality agricultural training is just the first step toward improving productivity of farms. However, understanding which farmers adopt improved practices after training and why is a real challenge.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Business Understanding: \n",
    "DigiCow supports smallholder farmers through digital tools, extension services, and targetted training programmes. However, like many real-world interventions, adoption rates remain low and uneven. The ability to predict adoption early can enable DigiCow and its partners to prioritise follow-ups, tailor support more effectively, and design stronger extension strategies. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Pitch: \n",
    "Predict the probability that a farmer will adopt a practice within 120 days of their first training, only using information available at the time of training. So the trained model must output predicted probabilities indicating the likelihood that a farmer will adopt a DigiCow-supported practice within the target time window (120 days of their first training).
